* Plant Pots

** General


*** Push in fittings
Push in fittings I use are metric, if this is difficult in US you might need to remodel the screw parts:

- 12mm OD tube / M12 screw for outlets
- 6mm OD tube / M12 screw for inlets

Important note here. You want an O-ring, my fittings come with O-rings. otherwise you need to deal with sillicone/teflon for water tightness, this is much more convinient, without leaks even when screwing into 3d printed parts

*** Connectors
[[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=gx+connectors&atb=v255-1&iax=images&ia=images][GX series connectors]] are cheap and very good quality.

Alternatively [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=SP+series+waterproof+connectors&t=ffab&atb=v255-1&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images][SP series is also nice]]

I use both interchangably

** Watering elements

I just leave it in a pot, would be nice to design some spikes that hold this thing in the soil, this whole element is mostly for fun, simpler elements (like gardena? (link it)) are fine here.

** Outlet

This is optional. If you have a sensor you can ensure your pot never gets overwatered and drips.

Goal here was to design an outlet that doesn't require watertight seal since this is difficult and unreliable long term.

We use a bottom convex element to capture water flowing around the screw, though we expect the bulk of water to flow through it.

*** Soil filter
This is probably annoying to print for most people, It function is to prevent large chunks of soil from entering the outlet tube. A random rock, fine netting, a sponge etc is ok for this as well.

*** In-pot element
Gives you a screw on the other side. You can adjust a height of this according to your pot bottom thickness

I sometimes print this in full size and break it off to size after fitting.
If your pot bottom is especially coarse you want to add sillicone where it connects to the pot to lower the flow, (you won't prevent it, especially long term)

*** Bottom convex element
Print this with a few walls (I use 4) to prevent random permiability.
You might want a random Z-seam alignment for the same reason as well.
Needs to be printed with supports.

Captures water that might leak from the sides of the screw. Provides a connection for a push-in fitting.


** sink pump
We detect water in the bottom container, auto-engage the pump to get rid of it.

My pump control box contains a power supply, a button for manual activation, and it looks like I used a relay to control the pump. Could have used TIP120 as well instead.

Control box takes power input, sensor input and provides pump output
