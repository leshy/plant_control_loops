# Outlet

This is optional. If you have a sensor you can ensure your pot never gets overwatered and drips.

Goal here was to design an outlet that doesn't require watertight seal since this is difficult and unreliable long term.

We use a bottom convex element to capture water flowing around the screw, though we expect the bulk of water to flow through it.

### Soil filter
This is probably annoying to print for most people, It function is to prevent large chunks of soil from entering the outlet tube. A random rock, fine netting, a sponge etc is ok for this as well.

### In-pot element
Gives you a screw on the other side. You can adjust a height of this according to your pot bottom thickness

I sometimes print this in full size and break it off to size after fitting.
If your pot bottom is especially coarse you want to add sillicone where it connects to the pot to lower the flow, (you won't prevent it, especially long term)

### Bottom convex element
Print this with a few walls (I use 4) to prevent random permiability.
You might want a random Z-seam alignment for the same reason as well.
Needs to be printed with supports.

Captures water that might leak from the sides of the screw. Provides a connection for a push-in fitting.
