* Push in fittings
Push in fittings I use are metric, if this is difficult in US you might need to remodel the screw parts:

- 12mm OD tube / M12 screw for outlets
- 6mm OD tube / M12 screw for inlets

Important note here. You want an O-ring, my fittings come with O-rings. otherwise you need to deal with sillicone/teflon for water tightness, this is much more convinient, without leaks even when screwing into 3d printed parts

* Connectors
